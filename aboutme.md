title: About me

---

My name is Isaac lopez and I am currently a data scientist in training at Lambda School. 

My main application for data science is using it in the Esports field. Ive always liked video games and never liked watching sports. That all change when Esports came into existence. I finally understand why people love watching other people play. Like those who want to work in the traditional sports industry I too would enjoy having some kind of involvent in Esports especialy now since its new and still has plenty of room for growth as a market.
